# E-Commerce Practice Application :shopping:

A design exercise, demonstrating my web design skills in an e-commerce setting. The goal of this challenge was to organize a large amount of product information in a visually appealing way. This beauty and skincare e-commerce site prototype was inspired by the playful yet functional designs on Glossier and Billie's direct-to-consumer sites.

## Deployed Application

View the [live site here](https://burragedanielle.github.io/E-CommPractice/).

## Features

This direct-to-consumer front-end site features dynamic elements including a self-written JavaScript function to dynamically update the images viewed on the page based on the user's clicks, tool-tips for clear calls-to-action, and hover-css features.

## Build Process

**Main Languages**:
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Frameworks**:
Utilized jQuery to manipulate the content on the page, Bootstrap as a baseframework and Sass as a CSS compiler.

**From Design To Execution**:
I wireframed and protyped my design using Figma. Using my prototype, I coded a dynamic front-end.

## What's Next? :seedling:

I plan to design and develop a homepage for this e-commerce site. I'd like to dive further into the development of a functional recommendation system, where users can select categories of skincare they'd like to have recommended to 'customize' their skin-care routine. Currently, I have the bones of this set up on the front-end, but would like to develop JavaScript to have an initial functional draft; in the eventual future, I'd like to hook this to a database of products that can be dynamically displayed to the screen.
