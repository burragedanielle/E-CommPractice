# E-Commerce Practice Application

A design exercise, demonstrating my web design skills in an e-commerce setting. The goal of this challenge was to organize a large amount of product information in a visually appealing way. This beauty and skincare e-commerce site prototype was inspired by the playful yet functional designs on Glossier and Billie's direct-to-consumer sites.

## Features

**Main Languages**
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Frameworks**
Utilized jQuery to manipulate the content on the page, Bootstrap as a baseframework and Sass as a CSS compiler.

**From Design To Execution**
I wireframed and protyped my design using Figma. Using my prototype, I coded a dynamic front-end.
